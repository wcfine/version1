      <hr>
      <h3>
        One FINE day F.I.N.E was created by Dr. Ramnath Ghute (Founder of Wealthcon), on April 8th, 2021. F.I.N.E means
        ‘Future Investors N Entrepreneurs’. It is a program to teach young children about finance, specifically 7th-9th
        grade.Most of the children in F.I.N.E did not know anything about finance but now we are learning things like
        MPTDS for selecting good companies and all basic Finance topics! In F.I.N.E they don’t teach you as they teach
        you
        in schools. For one there is no fixed syllabus so there is no rush and you can take your time to understand the
        topic and they interesting, practical and interactive projects which makes the topics simpler.

        <br>
        <h3>
          Hi everyone! I am sure that we all have received some money from our parents as pocket money and have been
          asked
          to save that for future, haven’t we? Parents do this so that we learn the concept of saving and the importance
          of money. And have you ever heard of the term finance, sure you did. First thing that comes to our mind is
          stock
          market and how it is risky and also that we can’t learn that, well it is actually not the truth.
          <br>
          <br>
          So in today’s blog we will be learning about finance from a student’s perspective. In this blog we only learn
          about the importance of finance for students. But In the following blogs I will be sharing about the basic
          concepts of it.
          <br>
          <br>
          First step, what is FINANCE? Finance is a term for the management, creation, and study of money and
          investments.
          Financial literacy means knowing how to manage your money effectively. It is not as hard as we think. Students
          can learn it too. But the question is why? Why should we?
          <br>
          <br>
          To start, I would suggest every student to read the book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad”. This book changed my way of
          looking at personal finance. It is all about importance of money and why should we invest it. Wait a minute,
          this is a new term- ‘Invest. What does it mean? Investing your money means act of allocating money, with the
          expectation of generating an income or profit. We’ll learn about this later.
          <br>

          In “Rich Dad, Poor Dad”, Robert T Kiyoski tells us that we don’t have to work for money instead make money
          work
          for us by investing it in different assets. Over the time, that money will grow! The book also states that if
          we
          (students) learn about this then we won’t have to suffer financially when we grow up. Because we will already
          know how to manage money make it work for us.
          <br>
          <br>
          So in this blog we looked at finance from student’s perspective and why is it important being financially
          literate when we are a student. Hope you all learned something from this blog and the upcoming blogs will be
          about the basic concepts of finance and then later we will learn about investment.

        <h1 style="color:#00b586;">Xenobots</h1>
        <h3>
          Xenobots are named after the African clawed frog. They are synthetic life forms designed by computers to do
          some
          desired function and built by combining together different biological tissues.
          <br>
          <br>
          We pronounce xenobots as “zeeno-bots”. Xenobots were first made(born) when scientists extracted skin stem
          cells
          from frog embryos and cultured them in salt water.
          <br>
          There is still a debate going on – whether xenobots are robots or organisms or something else. The first
          xenobots
          were built by Douglas Blackiston according to blueprints generated by an AI program, which was developed by
          Sam
          Kriegman.
          <br>
          They are used in medicine and environmental remediation. Their basic and main components are frog cells. They
          were
          invented in 2020. They can persist for weeks without food and heal themselves from lacerations (Cuts or skin
          wound).
          <br>
          <br>
          <image src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/50f5d7_519d5d4b2ca4417e81f2490550e5650e~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_211,h_158,al_c,q_90/50f5d7_519d5d4b2ca4417e81f2490550e5650e~mv2.webp" width="150px"></image>
          <br>
          <br>
          A xenobot is about 0.039 inches (less than 1 millimetre) wide. It is composed of just two things: Skin cells
          and
          heart muscle cells. xenobots can also self-replicate. xenobots can gather loose cells in their environment
          forming
          them into new xenobots with the same capability. Xenobots can walk, swim, push pellets and carry payloads.
          <br>
          Baby xenobots were created by a process called kinetic replication- phenomenon never
          <br>
          <br>
          observed before but known to happen at the molecular level. the best possible way to explain a xenobot is by
          calling it a "living, programmable organism." Xenobots reproduce by scooping up free-floating cells and
          assembling
          them into new clusters.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          These xenobots have some advantages as well as some disadvantages.
          <br>
          <br>
        </h3>
        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">
          Advantages:
        </h2>
        <h3>
          <br>
          1. They could carry out tasks inside our body to repair damage to organ. They can find out cancer cells in our
          body.
          <br>
          2. They can also attack microplastics in the ocean or could clean the oil spills.
          <br>
          3. The best advantage is that they are controllable, stoppable and a safe system.
          <br>
          <br>
        </h3>
        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">
          Disadvantages:
        </h2>
        <h3>
          <br>
          1. They can lead to loss of manufacturing and agricultural job.
          <br>
          2. Economies and market may crash.
          <br>
          <br>
          Lot of research is still going on xenobots. According to Sam Kreigman, he and his colleagues want to increase
          xenobots intelligence more. They also want to use them to understand biology better which can lead to
          regeneration
          of medicine.
